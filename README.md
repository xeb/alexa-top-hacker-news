# alexa-top-hacker-news
Simple Alexa example of getting the top 5 stories from Hacker News.

In order to test locally, go to the `src` directory and run `node test.js`.  To deploy the Skill, upload a zipped version of the **src** directory to an AWS Lambda function.  Then configure the Skill.

See: [Getting Started with the Alexa Skills Kit](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/getting-started-guide) for better directions.

**NOTE** there is a MUCH better version of getting the top hacker news.  Just ask Alexa for the top hacker news & see!  Don't use this skill ;)
